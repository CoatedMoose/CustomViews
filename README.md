CustomViews
===========

A set of views to use in an android application.

Included Views
--------------

### SignatureView

A view to capture an input signature. Can be used on its own, or part of a dialog/prompt.

Usage
-----

I am using the SignatureView as part of a dialog box myself. The demo code supplied uses it as part of another layout.

Install
-------

To build the library, run `ant jar` in the library directory, then copy the jar from `library/bin/customviews.jar` into your `libs` directory.

Demo should build just fine as an eclipse project, or using standard android ant targets, IE. `ant debug`.

License
-------

I haven't picked yet. Whatever it is, it will definitely be free for non-commercial use. Currently, I am considering releasing under the DWTFYWWI.

If anyone has an opinion between now and when I decide please let me know. If you are going to use this in your own project and need me to make a decision just shoot me a message/open an issue.
