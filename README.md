CustomViews
===========

A set of views to use in an android application.

Included Views
--------------

### SignatureView

A view to capture an input signature. Can be used on its own, or part of a dialog/prompt.

Usage
-----

I am using the SignatureView as part of a dialog box myself. It should work as part of any view though.

Install
-------

For now, just compile it as a library, drop it into your libs folder and add it to your build path. I will put together a real build script at some point.

License
-------

I haven't picked yet. Whatever it is, it will definitely be free for non-commercial use. Currently, I am considering releasing under the DWTFYWWI.

If anyone has an opinion between now and when I decide please let me know. If you are going to use this in your own project and need me to make a decision just shoot me a message/open an issue.
